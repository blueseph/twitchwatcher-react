# TwitchWatcher
##### A simpler way to watch twitch.

A small effort to both learn React/ES6, make a CI/deployment pipeline, and make Twitch a little easier to navigate.

A one-page app designed to make switching between streams as simple as possible.

* Filter by streamer name, channel status, or game.
* Show or hide Twitch Chat.
* All streams served in HTML5.
* (COMING SOON) Watch multiple streams at once.

See it working at http://savingthrow.io. (temporary)

Please note this will *not* work via https. Twitch doesn't support serving streams over https yet.
